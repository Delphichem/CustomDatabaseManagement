Before opening the project you'll have to install these packages, then restart Delphi.
-C:\3rd Party VCL\Delphi 2007 add ons\JEDI\jvcl\packages\d11\JVStdCtrls.dpk
-kbmMemTable
-SynEdit(in the SMSDataEditor svn folder)
-smcmpnt(in the SMSDataEditor svn folder)

Remember to update SMSDataEditor Manual with screenshots, etc if you add a feature. And delete it
from the list below.

TO DO

1. Close Tab bug.
Background
Have a brief look at uuTab, there is a class called 'tab'. The main form has an array of 'tab' objects. 
When you press one of the red crosses it calls the function CloseTab(aIndex : Integer). This function places the tab at the end by changing 
its pageindex, then shifts the objects in the array of tabs down by one so they remain lined up.

When you choose a table and press enter it calls the function SetTable, which grabs the text in the 
combobox and opens that table in the active tab. There is nothing wrong with this function.

The Problem
Open up a few tables, say 4. When you close the 3rd one, everything seems to work correctly, the other tabs move down.
But then if you try to open another table after that into one of the tabs, it stuffs up.
When you close a tab, the pgTable.ActivePageIndex seems to be correct at the end of the CloseTab 
function. But when you open a new table, the value of pgTable.ActivePageIndex has mysteriously 
changed to something else. The SetTable function tries to open the table using 
pgTable.ActivePageIndex. Where is it changing the value of pgTable.ActivePageIndex?

2. Pasting into the filter row 
Try pasting something into the yellow filter row. It doesn't trigger the filtering. You then
have to change a letter, then change it back just to trigger the filtering. Slightly annoying.
This filter row is an inbuilt feature of the SMDBGrid and should do it automatically. The grid 
doesn't seem to have any event that will catch the paste. Options I can think of;
- Somehow catch the windows WM_PASTE message when the filter row has focus
(something like this)
http://www.swissdelphicenter.com/torry/showcode.php?id=1403

then call 
tab[pgTable.ActivePageIndex].Grid.ApplyFilter;

- Do the same thing but catch the Ctrl+V keypress. This option if for noobs, easier but dirtier. Whatever works.

3. When you right click a node in the database tree when its expanded, it shows a pop up menu. But
at the same time it collapses the node. Annoying, we only want expanding/collapsing to happen
when left clicking. The treeview's mouse down event creates the pop up,
and the treeview's OnChange event does the expanding. The trouble with this is the order of events.

4. When you run a select query the grid/fields are made read only, unfortunately this stops the user from copying a cell.
We still want to allow this with changing the field. Maybe override the dataset OnBeforeEdit/OnAfterEdit event in uuTab.

5. Sub branch for tables/views/stored procedures/generators, etc in database tree.
Since SMS doesn't use any of these yet it's not really needed. But the TempSQLAlias (Head Office) does.
Nice feature to have anyway. The database functions needed would have to go into ISQLDataBase I think.

6. If you type 'sel' into the sql editor then press space, it autocompletes and puts in 'select'. We only want
it to autocomplete by pressing enter, not space. 

7. Add more sql keywords to AddSQLKeywordsToCompletionList

8. The method used for generating a select statement right is ok, it's quicker than typing. But a 
graphical approch like Microsoft SQL Server Studio's query builder would be better. Anyone got
the energy for this?

9. File association. Open file with SMSDataEditor.exe

9. Copy any needed features from Nexus data editor/DataBase Desktop...


UPDATING THE SMSCONFIG_MNEMONIC COMBOBOX ITEMS
-Open the latest config guide, press Alt+F11, select the project, Insert->Module
-Paste in this VB script and execute
Sub BkMarkList()
    Dim J As Integer

    Selection.TypeParagraph
    Selection.InsertBreak Type:=wdColumnBreak
    Selection.TypeText Text:="Bookmark list for "
    Selection.TypeText Text:=ActiveDocument.Name
    Selection.TypeParagraph
    For J = 1 To ActiveDocument.Bookmarks.Count
        Selection.TypeText Text:=ActiveDocument.Bookmarks(J).Name
        Selection.TypeParagraph
    Next J
    Selection.InsertBreak Type:=wdColumnBreak
End Sub
-It will place a list of bookmarks into the document, copy them into Excel(into the 2nd column)
-Put C1=, C2=, C3=, etc into the first column and save as .csv
-Open it as a text file and copy into SMSDataEditor.ini, commit it to SVN
